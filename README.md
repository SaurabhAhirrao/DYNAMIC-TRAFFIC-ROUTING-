Traffic congestion is a major challenge in urban areas, often caused by static traffic light systems that cannot adapt to real-time traffic conditions. This project presents a Dynamic Traffic Light Management System that uses YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once v8) for real-time vehicle detection and dynamically adjusts traffic light durations based on traffic density.

By integrating computer vision and intelligent traffic management, the system aims to:

Reduce waiting times at signals

Improve traffic flow efficiency

Minimize fuel consumption and emissions

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Deep Learning Framework: PyTorch

Object Detection Model: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

Hardware (optional): Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano for edge deployment

Other Tools: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

⚙️ Features

✔️ Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv8
